# myMathResearch
I just do math projects on here
(mostly playing around with libraries)
maybe something cool will come of this
current ideas:
Riemann-Zeta Function (finding zeroes)
Collatz conjecture (testing a bunch of numbers)
finding the area of a random step function
eulers identity
simple dice games
something with markov chains
testing simple trading algorithms against a random step variable
testing simpsons rule
finding other ways of numeric integration
