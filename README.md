# myMathResearch.
I just do math projects on here.
(mostly playing around with libraries).
maybe something cool will come of this.
current ideas:
Riemann-Zeta Function (finding zeroes).
Collatz conjecture (testing a bunch of numbers).
finding the area of a random step function.
eulers identity.
simple dice games.
something with markov chains.
testing simple trading algorithms against a random step variable.
testing simpsons rule.
finding other ways of numeric integration.
I want to research more about SDE but many prerequisites, have to grind.
possibly something about the Black-Scholes model.
I am trying to make a programme that lets users specify the dimensions of a vector they want to do calculations on and input elements into that vector (it's really hard).
I am implimenting math concepts from my linear algebra class.
There are some set theory functions that can help with finding unions, intersections, etc.
I need to add researchers
new researcher added, Ed Linihan
