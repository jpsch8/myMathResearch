# myMathResearch.
I just do math projects on here.
(mostly playing around with libraries).
maybe something cool will come of this.
current ideas:
Riemann-Zeta Function (finding zeroes).
Collatz conjecture (testing a bunch of numbers).
finding the area of a random step function.
eulers identity.
simple dice games.
something with markov chains.
testing simple trading algorithms against a random step variable.
testing simpsons rule.
finding other ways of numeric integration.
I want to research more about SDE but many prerequisites, have to grind.
possibly something about the Black-Scholes model.
I am trying to make a programme that lets users specify the dimensions of a vector they want to do calculations on and input elements into that vector (it's really hard).
I am implimenting math concepts from my linear algebra class.
There are some set theory functions that can help with finding unions, intersections, etc.
I need to add researchers
new researcher added, Ed Linihan.
added security policy, not sure what it does.
The matrix multiplication function is being built on the matrix multiplication branch, (just a reminder)
there needs to be something done with GUIs.
I should make a martingale betting strategy simulator.
Also experiment with other types of betting strategies. 
Is it possible to automate some physics calculations? 
I also want to do some experiments with lambda calculus but I am not smart enough for that, need to start studyMaxxing. 
I actually sited this repository in an English project, lol. 
How long will it take to learn enough to do computational PDE? 
Is there a way to show that some finite fields do not have multiplicative inverses? 
I have been reading about abstract algebra, it is very interesting, there are lots of computational problems to work through. 
I need to learn some numerical methods. 
Diophantine equations are the topic of some cool math research problems. Being able to solve these with a computer could definitely be of some value. Also this excersize would push me to try and optimize my code.
